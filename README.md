# Travel-Tracker

This program is a simple "travel tracker" that allows a user to track places they wish to visit and places they have already visited. The program reads and writes a list of places in a csv file, and each place has:
â€¢	name, country, priority, whether it is visited (v) or unvisited (n)
Users can choose to see the list of places, including the total number of places and unvisited places. The list will be sorted by visited status then by priority (decreasing number).
Users can add new places and mark places as visited. 
They cannot change places from visited to unvisited.
